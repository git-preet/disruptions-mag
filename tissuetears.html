    <h1>I Am Not A Tissue For Your White Tears</h1>
    <h2>june 23, 2020 ~ personal essay</h2>
    <p>Recently, I was in an argument with one of my (few) white friends, although I am not sure I can call them a friend anymore. They had become indignant after assuming I had accused them of wrongdoings. Though, I tried to explain that it was a mere miscommunication, I was once again patronized and dismissed. After reflecting on this conversation, I realized how manipulative the person was being.</p>
    <p class="emphasispar" styles=>Once again, I, a person of color, was guilted into apologizing for a white person’s mistake.<P>
    <p>Amongst my saltine-flavored peers, I have noticed the common theme of white fragility, white tears, and victim playing. Instead of acknowledging my rights to practice free speech on social media, I consistently was censored and pressured to “talk to them privately” before others could “get wrong ideas.” By shifting the blame onto people of color instead of learning from their mistakes, my toilet paper-shaded counterparts are actively exercising their privilege of the ability to minimize these issues. This turns their wrongdoings around forcing the blame onto others. </p>
    <p>Countless times throughout my adolescence, I have been targeted and guilt tripped
      by marshmallow-colored individuals. However, I understand that it’s the harsh reality of being a POC. Interestingly enough, every time a white person is rightfully called out, they feel as if their rights are being violated. Imagine how tired we are. Many do not want to be viewed as “bad” or “not woke.” However, there is no distinction between the “good” or “bad” in the vanilla frosting-colored population.</p>
    <p>What is prevalent are those who have a superiority complex and implicitly or explicitly play the “white savior” over and over again. Those waiting for a medal after doing the bare minimum of activism. Those who virtue signal, in an effort to show their “good” character, harm the people they claim to ally with. Not only is this the epitome of performative activism, which is counterproductive and inefficient, it illustrates caucasians do not actually care about anyone but themselves.</p>
    <p class="emphasispar">By shifting the narrative onto themselves, they are silencing the POC voices that actually matter. </p>
    <p>As a person of color, these situations are not only exhausting and stressful but also an utmost waste of time. Egg whites use their privilege to guilt trip and victim play, and in doing so, they are wasting POC’s most precious commodity: time. The fact that I even felt the urge to write this article and explain this again demonstrates the exhaustion POC are forced to face.</p>

    <ul style="list-style: none; font-style: italic;">
      <li>People of color should not tolerate and wait for white people to realize their mistakes.</li>
      <li>People of color are not tissues for your white tears.</li>
      <li>People of color should not be coerced into apologizing for things they did not do.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s easy for the mayonnaise-colored to repost something on Instagram, donate money, attend a protest, and call racist people out. It is equally as easy for them to be a hypocrite and excuse themselves from the white fragility narrative. White people are never excused, no matter how many documentaries you claim to have watched or how much money you have donated. If you are the same shade as Taylor Swift (or mildly tanner), you are benefiting from white supremacy. The racially privileged need to stop waiting for others to tell them what they did wrong and instead open their eyes and ears to hold themselves accountable.</p>
    <p>If you are seeking validation from POC every time you practice your definition of “activism,” do better. If you’re asking POC friends to give you history lessons unwarranted, do better. Google is free, and I am sure you can afford to buy some books too. If you want to be an ally, stop stealing from POC. Stop stealing narratives, space, and time. Do not post pictures of yourself on Instagram when others are fighting for basic human rights because the world does not revolve around you. Drop your racist/homophobic friends. It isn’t hard, so stop making excuses for yourself. Finally, learn to close your mouth (I know some of you may find it difficult because no one has ever told you to shut up in your life).</p>
    <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. If you are white and feel uncomfortable, angry, or offended after reading this—think about how people of color feel on the daily. These ideas are not radical and cannot be sugar-coated with two heart emojis at the end. This is the simple truth of the matter. Instead of closing this tab and moving on with your life, reflect on yourself and change. It’s human nature to feel defensive in these types of situations. However, admitting your mistakes instead of victim playing will be of the greater benefit. Your urge to be “woke” should not be tiring for others.</p>

    <p>Disclaimer: Ultimately, my experiences will never match the struggles BIPOC go through daily. These are little things that won’t change or end my life and have little effect on me in the long run. This is not the case for others.
