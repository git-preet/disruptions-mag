### Page Structure

Your website must be structured in accordance with the following specifications.

* All HTML files should be stored in the root directory.
* All image files should be stored in a folder called `images`.
* Your website must include at least 5 unique pages.

Each page must be structured consistently.

* A consistent header, which serves as your navigation bar, allowing users to navigate between pages.
   - Google some examples of what this might look like. Don't worry if yours doesn't look cool and fancy yet. We'll work on this when we learn more about CSS.
* A consistent footer, which includes the copyright (i.e., &copy; 2019-2020), a link to the UCVTS district page, and a link to the AIT school page.
   - The footer links do count towards the link requirement outlined below.

### Elements

Across each of your pages, your website must include the following.

* Headings
   - At least 1 unique `h1` element.
   - At least 1 unique `h2` element.
   - At least 1 more unique heading element (`h3`, `h4`, `h5` or `h6`).
* Paragraphs
   - At least 5 `p` elements.
* Lists
   - At least 1 `ol` element.
   - At least 1 `ul` element.
* Links
   - At least 7 external `a` elements (i.e., links that direct to another website that is not your own).
* Images
   - At least 7 `img` elements.
   - At least 1 of the `img` elements  must act as a link (this does not count towards the link requirement).
* Tables
   - At least one `table` element.

### Usability

It is your job to test your code. All images need to load. All links need to work. Open up the developer tools as you navigate to each of your pages. There should be no error messages showing up here. No exceptions.


### Submission Requirements

* Your code **must** be error-free. Code that fails to meet this minimum requirement will not be accepted.
* There must be **at least** 5 unique commits to your repository.
* Your code must meet each requirement outlined in the *Requirements* section.
* Your code must adhere to the course style guidelines.
