      <p class="album"> "Flower Boy" is the fifth studio album by Tyler the Creator. He starts off on "Foreword,"
        which is faster than the openers of his previous albums. It has a classic, repetitive
        synth background, which doesn't match the deeply political content of the rap. There's an
        interlude featuring Rex Orange County, a popular indie singer. The album continues through a
        couple more songs until it reaches "Who Dat Boy." This one features A$ap Rocky, a popular
        rapper. It's a sudden plunge into darker, heavier rap, with police sirens as part of the
        background. A little later in the album is "Boredom," a melodic song featuring Rex Orange County and Anna
        of the North. It has more of an indie vibe than hard rock. There are about six more songs until the
        album finishes on the track "Enjoy Right Now, Today." Unfortunately, this song is an anticlimactic
        end to the rollercoaster of music that is Flower Boy. It's simply a repetitive, three minute
        instrumental with few vocals. Overall, I find Flower Boy to be my second favorite album
        (the first being IGOR). Though some of the songs sound rather similar, the pure
        diversity and switches between genres in some of the songs is masterful.  </p>
