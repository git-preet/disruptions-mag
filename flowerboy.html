  <p> "Flower Boy" is the fifth studio album by Tyler the Creator. He starts off on "Foreword,"
  which is faster than the openers of his previous albums. It has a classic, repetitive
  synth background, which doesn't match the deeply political content of the rap. There's an
  interlude featuring Rex Orange County, a popular indie singer. The next song is called
  "Where This Flower Blooms,"" featuring Frank Ocean, another popular indie singer/rapper.
  This song has a relaxed beat and synth background. Frank Ocean's smooth vocals, like Kali
  Uchis' in Cherry Bomb, compliment Tyler's harsher rapping. The album continues through a
  couple more songs until it reaches "Who Dat Boy, in the middle of the album. This one
  features A$ap Rocky, an extremely popular rapper. It's a sudden plunge into darker,
  heavier rap, with police sirens as part of the background. A little bit later in the
  album is "Boredom," a softer, melodic song featuring Rex Orange County again and Anna
  of the North. It has more of Tyler singing, which is hard to find in his previous albums.
  It has more of an indie vibe than hard rock. There are about six more songs until the
  album finishes on the track "Enjoy Right Now, Today." Unfortunately, this song is a
  rather anticlimactic to the rollercoaster of music that is Flower Boy. It's simply a
  repetitive, three minute instrumental with a few vocals. Overall, I find Flower Boy to
  be my second favorite album (the first being IGOR). Though some of the songs sound rather similar, the pure
  diversity and switches between genres in some of the songs is masterful.  </p>
