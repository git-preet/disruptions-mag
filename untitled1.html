    <p style="text-align: center;">I walk and breathe, sleep and eat.
    <br>I wake up, I work, I dream.
<br>I exist.
<br>But do I live?
<br>No.
<br>Hell, this sounds like the set up to a riddle, come to think of it.
<br>Maybe it is.
<br>After all, we are riddles, paradoxes, contradictions.
<br>What comes of work but more life?
<br>What comes of life but more work?
<br>Why do we stay around in the first place,
<br>When we merely survive with the goal of staying alive?
<br>And so I walk, and breathe, and sleep, and eat.
<br>And wake up, and work, and dream.
<br>And I exist.
<br>But I do not live.
<br>I have never lived.
<br>Nobody has ever lived within our society.
<br>The scientific definition of life implies some sort of autonomy,
<br>Of which I have none.
<br>We want so desperately to have control.
<br>To have power.
<br>To choose.
<br>People have fought and died in wars for this cause,
<br>Sacrificed so much and suffered so horribly,
<br>All for a tiny glimpse, a morsel of a peek at it.
<br>At freedom.
<br>Freedom in any way, shape, or form.
<br>People will tell you that we have won these battles.
<br>That we are already  free.
<br>That we make choices, and therefore are free.
<br>I choose between starving and drowning, am I free?
<br>Hey, that seems like a pretty simple riddle.
<br>We work our whole lives so that we can hope to savour our last years on Earth undisturbed.
<br>To savour the glowing light of control,
<br>While the light of existence fades from us.
<br>Maybe it’s not a light at the end of the tunnel.
<br>Maybe it’s the window to the factory where the cogs are made.
<br>Those who are on the edge of the ultimate liberation peer inside,
<br>They see the young metal molded into shape.
<br>They see it cooled, hardened, turned into every other cog.
<br>All placed in a large machine.
<br>Turning, turning, turning.
<br>To run a gargantuan machine, for they are afraid of what happens when it stops.
<br>It’s all they know, it’s all they do.
<br>But what else is there to know or to do?
<br>When you were molded all your life to serve the purpose of the cog?
<br>And so how are we to know a world beyond the walls?
<br>Beyond the piles of money?
<br>Beyond the mountains of capital?
<br>We are not free relative to them.
<br>Not at all, nope, not in the slightest.
<br>It’s actually quite the opposite, in fact:
<br>We turn and turn and run and run for them,
<br>If we grind to a halt then we are cast out of the machine and are labeled “damaged”
<br>We turn in time with one another.
<br>A collective ballet of slaves,
<br>Arms interlocked,
<br>Fingers woven together
<br>All dancing to the somber but all-too-familiar rhythm of:
<br>“You have to work hard in order for success to come about!”
<br>What is success?
<br>Oh, I see.
<br>It’s bought.
<br>Everything is bought.
<br>Everything is sold.
<br>Ah, what a freedom it is to consume and to be consumed!
<br>My fellow people do not know me.
<br>They know a spectacle of me.
<br>They know the me that I produce for their consumption.
<br>To generate a social capital, of sorts.
<br>This me becomes me
<br>Here’s another paradox, then!
<br>I am a slave to myself!
<br>But how can that be?
<br>Honestly, who even cares at this point?
<br>I function not as a human, but as a relation.
<br>So what’s even the point of finding my true self?
<br>Financial relations are kind of similar to social relations in this sense, right?
<br>I make money.
<br>I am valued by my skill at making money.
<br>I hope that makes sense.
<br>Actually, you know what, no I don’t.
<br>Nothing makes sense so why should I?
<br>After all, the whole point of a paradox is that it doesn’t make any sense at all!
<br>And so I walk.
<br>And I breathe.
<br>And I sleep.
<br>And I eat.
<br>And I wake up.
<br>And I work.
<br>And I dream.
<br>And, of course, I exist.
<br>But do I live?
<br>Do I live in the sense that I have my own choices?
<br>That I can be my real self?
<br>That I can exist not through other people or other objects or other commodities,
<br>But alongside others?
<br>No, I do not live.
<br>Aw shit, I’m rambling again, aren’t I?
<br>Fuck, I really gotta lighten up.</p>
