    <h1>--on the refusal to acknowledge white privilege</h1>
    <h2>june 6, 2020</h2>

    <p>One of the first steps to uprooting the systematic racism and implicit bias built into our country is the acknowledgement of white privilege. How do racist white people just not confront their privilege? From raging white supremacists to disgusting police officers to teenage boys who think they can say the “n” word, there exists this lack of self-awareness that enables them to perform racist actions, ranging from sharing unwanted opinions to murder, towards people of color and other minority groups. As a Chinese-American, I think about my privilege all the time, even though it's not that of a white person. Perhaps they are so bountiful in privilege that it's just not a thought that comes to mind.</p>
    <p>Then, I think about how I would act if I were a white person, and if I weren’t confronted with adversity because of my skin color. Would I even think about racial and social privilege? Would I be selfish and remain ignorant or educate myself? Yet, at the same time, it's still inexcusable because how wouldn't I be confronted with my privilege with the news, education, and online resources that I would have? I'm thinking of those living in my town when I say this, but it can apply to other middle class and up communities. But now, I think about the issues I am still uneducated on and choose to ignore despite having resources due to being an upper-middle class Chinese-American living in the suburbs.</p>
    <p>For me, it’s a cycle of guilt and conflict, but I try to take it as an opportunity to educate myself. Meanwhile, for some white people, all it takes is a simple acknowledgement of their privilege to ease their own white guilt. Even in acknowledging privilege, they have privilege.</p>
    <p>It irks me when white people in the United States so readily prepare to defend themselves when called out for being ignorant of the advantages they have. They defend the police system because they know a “good police officer.” How do they not realize that the black community are the oppressed, whereas the police officers are the oppressors? They easily share their opinions about minorities, and when they are called out, they list their hardships as defense. Recognizing white privilege does not erase the adversity they experienced. It’s just that their adversity does not stem from the color of their skin.</p>
    <p>In writing this, I don't claim to be an expert in racism or an all-knowing, unproblematic activist. I am far from that. There is much that I don’t know. I also have enough self awareness to recognize that I make generalizations, but if we are constantly caught in the circle of “not all people are bad,” there will never be change. That’s why we need to call out those around us. White people must acknowledge and be aware of their privilege in everyday life. Of course, everyone must be held accountable, but is it not people with white skin who are born with an upper hand to black, brown, and yellow skin?</p>
    <p>The recents deaths of Ahmaud Artery and George Floyd have incited so many people to spread awareness on their Instagram stories and Twitter accounts. I can't help but think that some of those posts are performative activism, but to the white people who are genuinely upset because of their morals and sympathy, who are outraged that such a horrific act of racism is allowed in America, who experience “shock” from realizing that racism is, yes, real, I ask: where is this energy in your everyday life? It shouldn’t take the murder of innocent black men, innocent children, innocent people of color for you to realize that you have privilege.</p>
