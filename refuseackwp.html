    <h1>--on the refusal to acknowledge white privilege</h1>
    <h2>july 1, 2020 ~ opinion</h2>
    <p>The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, and hundreds of others at the hands of the police have incited many people to confront their privilege and spread awareness on their Instagram stories and Twitter accounts. I can't help but wonder: why did it take the murder of innocent black men, black womxn, black children, and other people of color for white people to realize that they have privilege?</p>
    <p>One of the first steps to uprooting the systemic racism built into our country is the acknowledgement of white privilege. How do racist white people just not confront their privilege? I’ve been bewildered by this thought for many years. From Ku Klux Klan terrorists to disgusting police officers to teenage boys who think they can say the “n” word, there exists this lack of self-awareness that enables them to perform racist actions, ranging from sharing unwanted opinions to murder, towards BIPOC and other minority groups. As a Chinese-American, I think about my privilege all the time, even though it's not that of a white person. Perhaps they are so bountiful in privilege that it's just not a thought that comes to mind.</p>
    <p>Then, I think about how I would act if I were a white person, and if I weren’t confronted with adversity because of the privilege that accompanies my skin color. Would I even think about racial privilege? Would I be selfish and remain ignorant or educate myself? Yet, at the same time, it's still inexcusable. How wouldn't I be confronted with my privilege with the news, education, and online resources that I would have, especially now with the Black Lives Matter movement? Ignoring this available information is like choosing to be stuck in the dark despite there being a light switch right next to me. I'm thinking of those living in my town when I say this, but it can apply to other middle class (and up) communities. But now, I think about the issues I am still uneducated on and choose to ignore despite having resources due to being an upper-middle class Chinese-American living in the suburbs.</p>
    <p>I wrote the last two paragraphs over a month ago, and since then, I have come to realize that being stuck in this cycle of guilt and conflict is ultimately useless. The privilege I have because of my identity will always exist, and acknowledging it is not enough. Acknowledgement is merely a preliminary step in making lasting changes. To make lasting changes and work towards “dismantling white supremacy,” I need to weaponize my privilege through constant confrontations of my own microaggressions and lifelong education and discussions.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, for some white people, all it takes is a simple acknowledgement of their privilege to ease their own white guilt. It’s evident from their “normal feeds” and countless beach posts (not following social distancing guidelines, may I add) that some people believe that posting an Instagram post flaunting their “solidarity” somehow absolves them of their role in white supremacy. <strong>Even in acknowledging privilege, they have privilege.</strong> They have the privilege to believe that acknowledgement is enough, to toss away resources that are shoved at their faces, to debate and trivialize a person’s trauma and personal experiences as if they were hypothetical, to justify murder. What a dangerous privilege to have.</p>
    <p>Choosing to be ignorant is truly telling of someone’s character and morals because it is a deadly choice. <strong>Ignorance is the seed that stems into racism, a thorny vine entangled in all parts of society, choking people of color and minorities to death.</strong> That’s why I will never understand how there are still white people in the United States who have not confronted their white privilege. It’s ingrained in our government, our justice system, our schools, our neighborhoods. You would think that the “superior white race” would simply open their eyes and ears to the truth.</p>
    <p>My hypothesis is that white people don’t want to acknowledge privilege because they would be taking the first step towards dismantling a system that they benefit from. They are afraid of what would happen if they weren’t born with an upper hand solely because of their skin color. Maybe that’s really the reason why they so fervently defend the police—not because they believe in “compassion” and “love” or know a “good police officer,” but because it is part of the racist system that they selfishly and fearfully want to uphold.</p>
    <p>(In writing this, I don't claim to be an expert in racism or an all-knowing, unproblematic activist. There is much that I don’t know and am learning every day. I also recognize that I make generalizations, but if we are always caught in the “not all people” rhetoric, there will never be change.
      Anyways, here are some resources that we can all use to educate ourselves: <em><a href="http://www.pb-resources.com/">PB Resources</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz011IF2Pu9TUWIxVWxybGJ1Ync">Black History Month Library</a>, <a href="https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/">Ways To Help</a></em>)</p>
