      <p class="intro">Tyler, the Creator, (real name Tyler Gregory Okonma) is a rapper, songwriter,
      singer, fashion designer, record producer, and more. He was born on March 6, 1991
      in Lader Heights, California. At the age of seven, he would begin to draw covers
      he had even begun to make music. At 14, he taught himself to play the piano.
      for his own imaginary albums, even including song titles and song lengths, before
      His first claim to fame was as a co-founder of an alternative band called Odd Future.
      This band also included many other popular singer/rappers, such as Earl Sweatshirt,
      Frank Ocean, and Matt Martians. After being in Odd Future for some time, Tyler decided
      to try some solo work and released his debut solo album, B*st*rd. Within the
      next decade, he released five more albums. His most recent album, Igor,
      was his first to debut at number on on the US Billboard 200.</p>
