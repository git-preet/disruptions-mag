<p>"Cherry Bomb,"" Tyler, the Creator's fourth studio album, opens up with a catchy tune
  called "DEATHCAMP,"" featuring Cole Alexander. With a repetitive yet enticing guitar
  riff, Tyler starts this album much stronger than he did "Wolf."" The next three songs,
  "BUFFALO," "PILOT,"" and "RUN,"" have a classic, ominous undertone. Though the rapping
  may not be too harsh, the strong synth backgrounds leave you on the edge of your seat,
  even once the song has ended. There's a sudden turn around with the fourth song, "FIND
  YOUR WINGS,"" featuring Roy Ayers, Syd, and Kali Uchis. This is personally my favorite
   on the album. There's a long introduction with just mallet percussion and electric
   guitar, which leads into Kali Uchis' smooth, sultry vocals. Her lilting voice
   combined with Tyler's harsher rapping is a lovely combination. The album continues
   through a few more songs, which show Tyler's more experimental side, using
   different synths and odd instruments. The album finishes off with "OKAGA, CA.
   Like in Wolf, this album ends on a softer note, with simple backgrounds and
   interesting lyrics. Cherry Bomb, in my opinion, is better than Wolf, simply
   because of the presence of more musical songs.</p>
