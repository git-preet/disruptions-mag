      <p class="album"> "Wolf" is Tyler, the Creator's third original studio album. The album opens
      up with a short melodic tune with the same name as the album. With somewhat
      angelic vocals and little rapping, upon first listen, this album seems to be
      lighthearted and musical. This first song alone implies that this album is
      going to be absolutely nothing like his first, rather crude albums: "Goblin"
      and "B*st*rd." Yet as the album progresses, we reach more harsh songs with
      heavier beats such as Trashwang. Though more profane music may float your boat,
      I personally did not enjoy much of the songs in the middle of the album.
      However, the album ends on "Lone," a soft, almost ballad like piece with soft
      piano & synth backgrounds. The rap is much gentler here, as are the lyrics.
      Elements found in this song are also found in Igor, Tyler's most recent album.
      Wolf, overall, is a good album, but may not particularly be to your taste if
      you’re not interested in more… angry stuff.</p>
