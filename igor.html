<p>"Igor" is Tyler, the Creator's sixth and most recent studio album. Unlike any
  of his other albums, Tyler starts off this album with a short, mostly instrumental
  piece called "IGORâ€™S THEME."" Next up is "EARFQUAKE," his most popular song off
  the album. It's personally not my favorite, because it's rather repetitive.
  However, the lyrics are softer and more loving than in previous albums. It also
  features Playboi Carti in a sort of useless mumble rap section. A few songs later
  is "NEW MAGIC WAND," a heavy rap song not unlike "Who Dat Boy" from his previous album,
  Flower Boy. It has harsh synth backgrounds and the lyrics aren't particularly
  interesting, yet I still enjoyed it. The next song is "A BOY IS A GUN*" my
  personal favorite on the album. The background music is soft and melodic, with
  occasional heavier beat drops. Released on September 20th, 2019, was the music
  video for this song. There are no words to describe it except beautiful. There's
  a gorgeous teal and white theme going on, which makes the song seem lighter than
  it is. All in all, I think that Igor is Tyler, the Creator's best album to date.</p>
