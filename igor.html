      <p class="album">"Igor" is Tyler, the Creator's sixth and most recent studio album. Unlike any
        of his other albums, Tyler starts off this album with a short, mostly instrumental
        piece called "IGORâ€™S THEME."" Next up is "EARFQUAKE," his most popular song off
        the album. It's personally not my favorite, because it's rather repetitive.
        However, the lyrics are softer and more loving than in previous albums. It also
        features Playboi Carti in a sort of useless mumble rap section. A few songs later
        is "NEW MAGIC WAND," a heavy rap song not unlike "Who Dat Boy" from his previous album,
        Flower Boy. It has harsh synth backgrounds and the lyrics aren't particularly
        interesting, yet I still enjoyed it. The next song is "A BOY IS A GUN*" my
        personal favorite on the album. The background music is soft and melodic, with
        occasional heavier beat drops. Released on September 20th, 2019, was the music
        video for this song. There are no words to describe it except beautiful. There's
        a gorgeous teal and white theme going on, which makes the song seem lighter than
        it is. Below are some stills from the video. All in all, I think that igor
        is Tyler, the Creator's best album to date.</p>
