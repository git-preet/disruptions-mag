      <p class="album">"Cherry Bomb,"" Tyler, the Creator's fourth studio album, opens up with a catchy tune
        called "DEATHCAMP,"" featuring Cole Alexander. With a repetitive yet enticing guitar
        riff, Tyler starts this album much stronger than he did "Wolf."" The next three songs,
        "BUFFALO," "PILOT,"" and "RUN,"" have a classic, ominous undertone. Though the rapping
        may not be too harsh, the strong synth backgrounds leave you on the edge of your seat,
        YOUR WINGS,"" featuring Roy Ayers, Syd, and Kali Uchis. This is personally my favorite
        on the album. There's a long introduction with just mallet percussion and electric
        guitar, which leads into Kali Uchis' smooth, sultry vocals. Her lilting voice
        combined with Tyler's harsher rapping is a lovely combination. The album continues
        through a few more songs, which show Tyler's more experimental side, using
        different synths and odd instruments. The album finishes off with "OKAGA, CA.
        Like in Wolf, this album ends on a softer note, with simple backgrounds and
        interesting lyrics. Cherry Bomb, in my opinion, is better than Wolf, simply
        because of the presence of more musical songs.</p>
